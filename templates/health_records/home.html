        <h2 class="section-title">Born from a Critical Need</h2>
        <div class="problem-content">
            <p class="problem-text">
                ShareMyCare was created after a life-threatening experience where a paramedic's assessment was completely wrong, 
                and medical records were inaccessible even with proper consent. As a healthcare professional, intervention was required 
                to ensure proper care - a decision that ultimately saved a life.
            </p>
            <p class="problem-text">
                This highlighted a fundamental gap: in emergency situations, healthcare providers need immediate access to complete 
                medical histories to make accurate assessments. Patients and families must be able to share critical health information 
                when it matters most.
