# ShareMyCare

## The Problem

ShareMyCare was born from a life-threatening gap in healthcare accessibility. When a family member was taken to hospital, the paramedic's assessment was completely wrong and advised them to see a doctor the next day for strong pain relief. As a healthcare professional i picked up on many red flags that warranted an admission to hospital and had to advise the paramedics at the time, ultimately allowing the family member to be taken to accidents and emergencies. 

As a healthcare professional, intervention was required to force the paramedic's hand to hospitalise my family member - a decision that ultimately saved her life. The patient was too drowsy and in severe pain to provide the correct details to the doctor, so a full medical history had to be provided verbally to the A&E doctor that led the the correct course of action. A complete, accessible medical history could have sped up decision-making from paramedic to A&E doctor, potentially preventing the critical misassessment.

This experience highlighted a fundamental issue: in emergency situations, paramedics and emergency staff need immediate access to complete medical histories to make accurate assessments. Patients and their families must be able to share critical health information when it matters most, especially when patients cannot advocate for themselves.

## About

Share My Care = A secure web platform where patients store their health info (conditions, medications, assessments) and choose which clinicians can view it.

Think: a digital health passport + record system.

The platform streamlines the clinical workflow by providing clinicians with immediate access to patients' medical records, significantly reducing the time spent on history taking and subjective assessments during consultations.

**Important:** The platform allows patients to record all medications they are taking, including those not prescribed by a healthcare provider. This is critical information that may not appear in official medical records but is essential for clinicians and emergency responders to make informed treatment decisions and avoid potentially dangerous drug interactions.
