# ShareMyCare

## The Problem

ShareMyCare was born from a life-threatening gap in healthcare accessibility. When a family member was taken to hospital, the paramedic's assessment was completely wrong, and attempts to access medical records with proper consent were blocked because the records were stored on a system that couldn't be accessed. 

As a healthcare professional, intervention was required to force the paramedic's hand to hospitalize the patient - a decision that ultimately saved her life. The patient was too drowsy to provide details, so a full medical history had to be provided verbally to the A&E doctor. A complete, accessible medical history could have sped up decision-making from paramedic to A&E doctor, potentially preventing the critical misassessment.

This experience highlighted a fundamental issue: in emergency situations, paramedics and emergency staff need immediate access to complete medical histories to make accurate assessments. Patients and their families must be able to share critical health information when it matters most, especially when patients cannot advocate for themselves.

## About

Share My Care = A secure web platform where patients store their health info (conditions, medications, assessments) and choose which clinicians can view it.

Think: a digital health passport + physiotherapy record system.

The platform streamlines the clinical workflow by providing clinicians with immediate access to patients' medical records, significantly reducing the time spent on history taking and subjective assessments during consultations.
